## What is this?
This is a proof of concept I have built to sort of look at alternative things you can build with Headless WordPress - using the right tools and knowledge you can build something that is pretty usable off the shelf to replace something like The Events Calendar in normal WordPress

## What could this be used for?
Ideally inspriation, a stepping off point or a scaffold for certain sites. Small projects that need a calendar to show dates, like a small town site, or something like intricate booking forms or customer based events that need to be managed by a team.

With ACF at its core, you can really do whatever you need

## How to use this

You need to create a custom post type called Event Details (I used CPT UI from WebDevStudios),
